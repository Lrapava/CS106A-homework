# Namesurfer extension

I used this homework assignment as an opportunity to showcase & learn about common methods of interpolation. 

I also derived all the formulae for those methods myself, which required me to apply some of the previously gained knowledge of linaer algebra and calculus, and to implement mathematical methods such as vector addition, multiplication, Gaussian elimination & back substitiution.

# Features

Additional features include:

* Linear interpolation (default)
* Lagrange interpolation
* Cubic interpolation
* Cubic interpolation (continues in 2nd derivative, unstable)
* Interpolation mode indicator
* "Change Interpolation Mode" button
